### Don't use, project incomplete

The idea for this project was a tool to help users manage multiple github accounts from one machine, since for some reason that workflow is overly complex

After working on it for a while I realized this abstraction is kind of pointless, and a user would be better off just reading a tutorial on how to manage it themselves

Was fun to work on nonetheless, got some good experience with clap.rs as well as file system management in Rust
